We want a panel inside our main frame. This panel keeps track of all the bodies
in the world and provides gui to add/remove/edit world bodies.

The classes should be something like this:

MainBodyPanel:
	BodyListPanel
		BodyPanel
			JLabel //body type
			BodyViewButton //makes a pop-up that edits the body
			RemoveBodyButton //removes tracking of this body
	AddNewBodyButton


Classes are thus:
	MainBodyPanel
	BodyListPanel
	BodyPanel
	BodyViewButton
	RemoveBodyButton
	AddNewBodyButton

public class MainBodyPanel extends JPanel implements ActionListener
{
	
	RemoveButton rmbuttons;
	JButton newbutton;
	BodyListPanel bodylist; // this object actually tracks and displays bodies
	
	/** Makes a new Panel that tracks bodies in world. */
	public MainBodyPanel();
	
	/** Checks for a button click that adds or removes a body from panel. */
	public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent event);
	
	/** Makes a new body for the panel to track. */
	private void addNewBody();
	
	/** Removes a tracked body by its ID. */
	private void removeBody(int ID);
